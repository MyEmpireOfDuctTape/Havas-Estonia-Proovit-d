# Havas-Estonia-Proovitööd
# Havas trial for Full Stack Developer. 

The trial consists of 3 excercises, which all need to be pushed to this repo.
When starting, create a branch with your name and only push to that. 
If you push to the master, you are part of the boys and will be disqualified.

# 1.	Create a javascript project . 
Its role is to 
- search for a movie by a string.
- then return the overview, tagline and vote_average  of the first three movies returned at the same time, not in sequence. 
You do not have to show the result other than as a console.log value, but plus points are given if you use a JS SPA , make the search changeable by the user, or somehow visualize the data as HTML. You may use any library.

Api to use: api.themoviedb.org  - create your own account and API key.

# 2.	Make a simple wordpress plugin that adds an options page which contains a grid of links to all the posts in the wordpress.
If the post has a thumbnail, display that, otherwise display a grey square instead of it. Below the square or picture display the post title and the excerpt. Both the picture/square and title have to link to the edit page of the post. The excerpt does not.

# 3.	Write a function to return the fibonacci sequence at number n which is a positive integer.
Something like this. 
return_fib_at_n(3) -> 2
return_fib_at_n(8) -> 21

Write both an iterative and a recursive function that do the same thing.
Explain in comments under the code, which is better for faster computing and why.

You may use any language. (please no VBA)


Good luck!
